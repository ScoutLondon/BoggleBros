Project: BoggleBros Website (Per Scholas Graduation Capstone)

An e-commerce pet rat sales site.  Site visitors will be able to view all available rats, register as 
an adopter(referred to as users going forward), and login.  Users will be able to view all available 
rats, place reservations on rats they like, view a display of all the rats they have pending reservations 
on, and view their adoption order (display of all the rats with approved reservations).  Admins will be 
able to view all rats regardless of availability status, edit rat details, view all reservations 
regardless of status, and edit reservation details.  Modifications are saved into connected database.
